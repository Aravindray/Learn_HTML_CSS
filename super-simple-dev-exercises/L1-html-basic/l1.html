<p>Hello, World!</p>
<p>
    I Woke up at 9 and then wash the dishes, get bath and ignore my breakfast and prepare the brunch which is salad, while preparing I cut my finger (so sad...). Then I started working on taco shop project by dave gray finally I have completed it today, then a little nap, after that I start washing super simple dev video to learn html and css, just for more practice and exercises.
